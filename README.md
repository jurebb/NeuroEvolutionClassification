# NeuroEvolutionClassification
Combines a feedforward neural network, parameters for which are 'learned' using an eliminational genetic algorithm.
Utilizes two types of neurons:
Type one (first hidden layer) - generates a similarity measurement between input data and stored parameters vectors
Type two (second hidden layer - last layer) - sigmoid function
Built for an uni course.
